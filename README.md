# Creating-and-Using-Generics-in-TypeScript

This is the official repository for my Pluralsight course titled [*Creating and Using Generics in TypeScript*](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-generics-creating-using/table-of-contents). 
The *master* branch contains code as it 
exists at the start of the course. There are separate branches named after the modules in the course that contain the code as it 
exists at the end of that module.

I will update this repo below with any problems or small issues reported between updates to the actual course.

Also be sure to check out my introductory TypeScript course at Pluralsight titled [*TypeScript: Getting Started*](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-typescript/table-of-contents). 

Thanks for watching and good luck on your TypeScript projects!
